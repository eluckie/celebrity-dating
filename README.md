## Description

This is a simple webpage created to explore core HTML concepts of gathering information from our user via a form. It is also intended to explore basic JavaScript functions and logic. Users are asked to fill out their age and height and branching is used to determine which Monsters Inc. character they would be compatible with. Options include Mike, Sully, Roz, and nobody. If a user does not enter either their age or height, an error message is shown to remind them before a result will display. This webpage is intended to be a fun quiz to explore basic JavaScript operations.
